- **Spark Join Strategies**:
  - **Broadcast Hash Join (BHJ)**:
    - Also known as map-side-only join.
    - Used when one dataset is small (fits in driver’s and executors’ memory) and another is large.
    - Small dataset is broadcasted to all executors using Spark broadcast variable.
    - Default threshold for broadcasting: 10 MB (configurable via `spark.sql.autoBroadcastJoinThreshold`).
    - Fastest join, avoids data shuffling.
    - Requires sufficient memory on both driver and executors.
